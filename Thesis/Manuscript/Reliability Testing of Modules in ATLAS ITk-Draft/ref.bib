                      that describe the upgrade of the central tracking system for
                      the ATLAS experiment for the operation at the High
                      Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) starting in the middle of 2026. At
                      this time the LHC will have been upgraded to reach a peak
                      instantaneous luminosity of $7.5x10^34$ $cm^[-2]s^[-1],$
                      which corresponds to approximately 200 inelastic
                      proton-proton collisions per beam crossing. The new Inner
                      Tracker (ITk) will be operational for more than ten years,
                      during which ATLAS aims to accumulate a total data set of
                      3,000 $fb^[-1].$ Meeting these requirements presents a
                      unique challenge for the design of an all-silicon tracking
                      system that consists of a pixel detector at small radius
                      close to the beam line and a large-area strip tracking
                      detector surrounding it. This document presents in detail
                      the requirements of the new tracker, its layout and expected
                      performance including the results of several benchmark
                      physics studies at the highest numbers of collisions per
                      beam crossing. The design, construction and expected
                      performance of the large-area silicon-strip tracker are set
                      out in detail. These include the results of measurements of
                      prototype modules and associated support structures and the
                      plans for their mass production. A short description is
                      given of the state of the development of the pixel tracker,
                      which will be presented in detail in the second Technical
                      Design Report document one year from now. This document will
                      also describe the management of the project, its schedule
                      and major milestones. The costs of the new tracker and the
                      collaboration that plans to build it are also presented.},

abstract = {Radiation-tolerant n+-in-p silicon sensors were developed for use in very high radiation environments. Novel n+-in-p silicon strip and pixel sensors and test structures were fabricated, tested and evaluated, in order to understand the designs implemented. The resistance between the n+ implants (interstrip resistance), the electric potential of the p-stop, and the punch-through-protection (PTP) onset voltage were measured before and as a function of fluence after irradiation. The technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations were used to understand the radiation damage and fluence dependence of the structures. The decrease in the interstrip resistance is a consequence of increased leakage current. The decrease in the electric potential of the p-stop results from a build-up of positive charge in the silicon–silicon oxide interface. The decrease and subsequent increase in the PTP onset voltages results from the interface charge build-up and an increase in acceptor states.}

abstract = {We have been developing a novel radiation-tolerant n+-in-p silicon microstrip sensor for very high radiation environments, aiming for application in the high luminosity large hadron collider. The sensors are fabricated in 6in., p-type, float-zone wafers, where large-area strip sensor designs are laid out together with a number of miniature sensors. Radiation tolerance has been studied with ATLAS07 sensors and with independent structures. The ATLAS07 design was developed into new ATLAS12 designs. The ATLAS12A large-area sensor is made towards an axial strip sensor and the ATLAS12M towards a stereo strip sensor. New features to the ATLAS12 sensors are two dicing lines: standard edge space of 910μm and slim edge space of 450μm, a gated punch-through protection structure, and connection of orphan strips in a triangular corner of stereo strips. We report the design of the ATLAS12 layouts and initial measurements of the leakage current after dicing and the resistivity of the wafers.}
