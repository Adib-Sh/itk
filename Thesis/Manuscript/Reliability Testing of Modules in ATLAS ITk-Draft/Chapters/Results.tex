During the development stage of the test and data collection, several tests were performed in order to find the relevant data and calibrate the output of the data according to our needs. Following, we will provide the result of two separate full tests which were made to both test the stability of the LTRT process, and after that capture the environmental and AMAC electrical data from InFlux.\footnote{\textcolor{blue}{Please note that the LTRT results shown are from a Pre Production A (PPA) module, and solely presented for the proof of concept and the results do not reflect the validity and functionality of the module.}} \\

\end{figure}

The first test was performed at $0 \si{\celsius}$ with $2$ iteration of LTRT and an interval of $10$ minutes between the two cold LTRTs. The timetable related to this test is shown in Fig\ref{fig:LTRTinflux}. The results of the ABCstar full test are shown in Fiq.\ref{fig:LTRT_result_1} and Fiq.\ref{fig:LTRT_result_2} showing the result of the two attempts of the performed test. (and Fiq.\ref{fig:LTRT_result_1_large} and Fiq.\ref{fig:LTRT_result_2_large} for higher resolution)

Each point in the plots above shows the value of a single channel, and each highlighted area divides the data from each ABCstar readout (for this case $9$ readout per hybrid).\\

The environmental data related to both "LTRT COLD TEST 1" and "LTRT COLD TEST 2" and the "IDLE" period in between two tests is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:env_1}(and Fiq.\ref{fig:env_1_large} for higher resolution)

The AMAC electrical data related to this test is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:amac_1}(and Fiq.\ref{fig:amac_1_large} for higher resolution)

While the time taken for each test varies depending on the module, configuration, and settings, by aligning the ordered tests with the environmental and electrical data, we can have a general overview of the test conditions. \\
By checking the environmental plots we can determine that the temperature on the chuck which the module was installed on, was perfectly constant during the LTRT COLD TESTs and the IDLE period and was maintained at $0\si{\celsius}$. The dew point, however, is decreasing. Since the dew point is directly proportional to relative humidity and the air temperature, we can see that this change is a result of the decrease in relative humidity during the full test. Although the air temperature (RH Temp.) showing step-like decrease during each stage, but the
