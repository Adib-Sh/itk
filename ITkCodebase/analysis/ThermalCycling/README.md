# Barrel and endcap channel classification during thermal cycling studies

## Subdirectories

CycleToDeath/ plots trends of the 100 consecutive thermal cycles on four LS modules, from April-May 2023

GlobalPlots/ holds, eventually publication quality, plots that combine a lot  of different modules.

Other subdirectories hold, arbitrarily grouped, data from different institutes and times. Notably, inside these are often .txt files defining what test filenames correspond to which cycle, and whether they are cold vs warm or shunted vs unshunted tests.
